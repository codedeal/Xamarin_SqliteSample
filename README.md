# Xamarin_SqliteSample

Xamarin.Forms supports database-driven applications using the SQLite database engine,
which makes it possible to load and save objects in shared code. 
This git project describes how Xamarin.Forms applications can read and write data to a local SQLite database using SQLite.Net.

# Prerequisites

use the SQLite.NET PCL NuGet package to incorporate database operations into shared code by referencing the SQLite classes
that ship in the NuGet. Database operations can be defined in the .NET Standard library project of the Xamarin.Forms solution.
